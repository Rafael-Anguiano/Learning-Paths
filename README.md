# Learning Paths - Coding Interview Preparation

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises and solutions that I've completed to prepare for coding interviews. The exercises are organized by topic and difficulty to facilitate structured learning and practice.

## Repository Structure

- **Coding-Interview**: General coding interview problems and solutions
- **Design_Patterns**: Implementation examples of common software design patterns
- **Leetcode**: Solutions to LeetCode platform problems
- **Preparation-for-Interview**: Specific materials focused on interview preparation
- **Search**: Implementations and problems related to search algorithms
- **Sorting**: Various sorting algorithm implementations and related problems
- **Specialization**: Topic-specific advanced problems and solutions

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

1. A personal archive of solved problems
2. A reference for reviewing key algorithms and data structures
3. A tool for tracking progress in interview preparation
4. A resource for quick review before interviews

## How to Use

Each directory contains problems organized by topic. Solutions are typically implemented with:

- Clear problem statements
- Solution code
- Time and space complexity analysis (where applicable)
- Alternative approaches (where applicable)

## Key Topics Covered

- Array and String manipulation
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting and Searching
- System Design
- Object-Oriented Design

## Contributing

This is a personal learning repository, but suggestions for improvements are welcome.
